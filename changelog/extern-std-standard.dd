C++ compability standard now c++11 by default

The default setting for `-extern-std=` has been updated to c++11.

Declarations with `extern(C++)` linkage are no longer guaranteed to link with
code compiled by a C++98 compiler. Additionally, C++ headers generated by `-HC`
will use constructs only available from C++11 onwards.

If compatibility with older C++ compilers is required, you must now pass
`-extern-std=c++98` on the command-line.
